We are interested in a program which receives a word as input and prints the name of the 
documents in the whole file set which include that word. The file set includes several text files as 
documents with a unique name. Each file has several words or a paragraph. You must create your 
own files and file set. 
The goal is to find and print the name of documents including a given word in a constant time using 
hashing techniques. 
For implementation, all files and words should be read by your program at first to create a hash
table array. Each element in the array stores a linked list that corresponds to a word. The nodes of 
the lists represent the files which include that word. Lists nodes may/may not be sorted. 
Once the program receives an input word, it generates its key index using a hashing function and 
then jumps to that index in the array and prints the content of all nodes of that linked list. 
In order to avoid collision, you may use a long array. For conflict resolution, use open address linear 
or quadratic probing. 
You may assume that there are only 10 files (1.txt, 2.txt, …, 10.txt). Each file includes a paragraph, in 
which, words have been separated by space.
